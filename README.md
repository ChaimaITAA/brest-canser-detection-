# Brest-canser-detection-
this a machine learning project implemented on python, following an online course.
# I started by checking the python version and libreries 
This step helped throught code errors since the course was uploaded 3 years ago and
so many python updates happened since then.
# Then I imported the required libreries
I worked with sklearn which is is probably the most useful library for machine learning in Python. it contains a lot of useful componant such as:
+Supervised learning algorithms.
* Cross-validation.
* Unsupervised learning algorithms.
* Various toy datasets.
* Feature extraction.
this librery helped me further in the project to explore the dataset and it alowed me to use machine learning methods which were useful to make a precise decision about the data.
# Then we apply some changes on the dataset to adapt the data and we explore the data here are the steps that I followed:
* Preprocess the data
* Explore the dataset and do a few visualizations:
  * Print the shape of the dataset: this step show all the dataset column and give an idea about the type of data that we are dealing with
  * Describe the dataset: the dataset discription helps give information of the range of values of every symptom indicator.
  * Plot histograms for each variable.
  * Create scatter plot matrix.
# The next step would be interacting with the modules and training:
In this step we chose two modules:
  * support vector machines(SVM).
  * k-nearest neighbors(KNN).
the next step was testing these two modules to chose which one is more accurate 
# The last step is to work with the chosen module to detect potential existing breast cancer.
